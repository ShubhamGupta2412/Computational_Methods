Implementation to be done on C/C++
1.
a) Write a program to print all odd positive integers less than 100, 
omitting those divisible by 7.
b) Write a program to determine the number of integers between 1 and 
2000 that are not divisible by 2, 3 or 5 but are divisible by 7.

5. Write a program to predict this year's rainfall using the Lagrange 
Interpolation method. Use the annual rainfall data for the last 10 years in 
your city. Is the answer obtained reasonable?
6. Using 21 equally spaced nodes on the interval [-5 5], find the interpolating 
polynomial 𝒑(𝒙) of degree 20 for the function 𝒇(𝒙) =

8. Write a program to calculate a point of minima for a given function and an 
interval. The search should continue until a pre-assigned error bound is 
reached but not beyond 100 in each case. Run the program for f(x) =|ln x| 
on [0.5, 4].
9. Write a program to solve 𝒙
